Herein lie tools for building models using Blender's Python API, and a [bunch](lens-cap.py) [of](draintray.py) [scripts](change-sorter.py) that create models.

The tools are part of a rather specific workflow which is intended to imitate [OpenSCAD](https://openscad.org/), where you can edit a file (in your own editor) and it is updated on the fly in Blender.
